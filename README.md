# ee631-final-project

Our final project has three main components:

1. 3D AR rendering of a chess board and pieces

Marker tracking: we need more than one ArUco marker to make sure all 3D AR rendering remain visible during a user's hand movement.

2. Human hand geture detection in 3D space

Class: HandDetector

3. A chess engine to keep track of the game state

Class: a chess game
